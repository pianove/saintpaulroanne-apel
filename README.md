APEL School Supply Ordering Site



This is my first volunteer project that builds a school supply list display and ordering site. 
You can display school supply list from grade K till 9 within the French education system. 
Then by filling a form you can order your kit.

This project helps tremendously PTA volunteer parents to school supply kit order processing hussle.

My future plan is to add a payment feature to make the process completely automated.
